## Introduction

#### About me

.right-column[
I'm Carlos!

I've been paid to write Java, Scala and PHP.

I've been kindly asked to write Ruby, Python, Clojure, Objective-C.

I'm in (newfound) love with Haskell.

## What this talk is about

#### Results oriented

We're concerned with results rather than performance.

#### Not about ORMs

Generating queries is not about mapping data types to database
rows.

#### PostgreSQL

The commonly-supported RDMBS between the libraries we'll be seeing is
PostgreSQL. Another one would be sqlite.red[\*], which is a simpler database.

.footnote[.red.bold[\*] Although to use sqlite we'd have to download an
alternative version of Opaleye.]
