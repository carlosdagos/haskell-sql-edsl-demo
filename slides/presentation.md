## Introduction

.left-column[
#### About me

.right-column[
I'm Carlos.

I've been paid to write Java, Scala and PHP.

I've been kindly asked to write Ruby, Python, Clojure, Objective-C.

I'm in (newfound) love with Haskell.

## What this talk is about

#### Results oriented

We're concerned with results rather than performance.

#### Not about ORMs

Generating queries is not about mapping data types to database rows.

#### PostgreSQL

The commonly-supported RDMBS between the libraries we'll be seeing is
PostgreSQL. Another one would be sqlite.red[\*], which is a simpler database
engine.

.footnote[.red.bold[\*] Although to use sqlite we'd have to download an
alternative version of Opaleye.]

---

## Sample application and design

We'll be looking at how to make an application that will allow me
to add TODOs, read them, and complete or discard them.

#### Sample output

We want to see all our TODOs

```bash
$ todos list
1. Buy food            (due by: 2016-05-20) (priority: 5 )
2. Call parents        (due by: 2016-05-20) (priority: 7 )
3. Wash clothes        (due by: 2016-05-23) (priority: - )
4. Finish presentation (due by: 2016-05-19) (priority: 10)
5. Call boss           (due by: 2016-05-18) (priority: 20)
```

We want to find specific ones

```bash
$ todos find 1
Todo:     Buy food
Due by:   2016-05-20
Priority: 5
Hashtags: #independence #responsible
```
---

## Sample application and design

#### Sample output

We want to complete a TODO

```bash
$ todos complete 4
üëçüèº Completed 'Finish presentation #haskellerz'
```

Of course we also want to add a TODO

```bash
$ todos add 'Display presentation at Haskellerz!' \
            --due-by   '2016-05-19'               \
            --hashtags '#haskellerz, #fun'        \
            --priority 10
Added TODO with id 6
```

So far this is a basic CR~~U~~D. But what about more complex queries? No software
is complete without its flags. Plus, from `$ todos find 1` we saw that our app is aware
of the concept of a "hashtag", as well as due dates.

---

## Sample application and design

#### Sample output

List TODOs that are due by a certain date.

```bash
$ todos list --due-by '2016-05-20' --with-hashtags
1. Buy food     (due by: 2016-05-20) (priority: 5) #independence #responsible
2. Call parents (due by: 2016-05-20) (priority: 7) #good-son
```

List TODOs that are due on a certain date, and belong to a certain hashtag.

```bash
$ todos list --due-by '2015-05-20' --order-by-priority --hashtag "#responsible"
2. Call parents (due by: 2015-05-20) (priority: 7) #good-son
1. Buy food     (due by: 2015-05-20) (priority: 5) #independence #responsible
```

List TODOs that are already late...

```bash
$ todos list --late --with-hashtags
5. Call boss (due by: 18 May 2016) (priority: 20) #good-employee
```

## Sample application and design

#### Database design

.pull-left[
<br>
<img src="images/todo_db.png" alt="todo database design" width="340" />
]

.pull-right[
```sql
create table todos(
  id serial primary key,
  title varchar(50) not null,
  due_date date not null,
  prio int
)

create table hashtags(
  hashtag varchar(50) not null,
  todo_id int not null,
  primary key (hashtag, todo_id)
)
```
]

---

## Sample application and design

#### (Some of the) queries we'll need

To see all our TODOs
```sql
select * from todos
```
To find a specific TODO
```sql
select * from todos where id = ?
```
To complete a TODO
```sql
delete from todos where id = ?
```
To add a TODO
```sql
insert into todos (title, due_date, prority) values (?, ?, ?)
```
---

## Sample application and design

#### Database design

List TODOs that are due by a specific date
```sql
select * from todos where due_date = ?
```
List TODOs ordered by priority
```sql
select * from todos order by prio
```
List late TODOs
```sql
select * from todos where due_date < current_date
```
List TODOs due on a specific date and belonging to a certain hashtag
```sql
select * from hashtags h
join todos t on h.todo_id = t.id
where h.hashtag  = ?
and   t.due_date = ?
```

## Current state of things

#### Leon Smith's [`postgresql-simple`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple)

I can design my types normally

```haskell
-- file simple/src/Simple/Todo.hs
data Todo = Todo { getId       :: !(Maybe Int) -- Can be null
                 , getTitle    :: !String      -- Title of the todo
                 , getDueDate  :: !Date        -- Date of the todo
                 , getPrio     :: !(Maybe Int) -- Priority of the todo
                 } deriving (Show)

-- file simple/src/Simple/Hashtag.hs
data Hashtag = Hashtag { getTodoId  :: !(Maybe Int) -- Can be null
                       , getHashtag :: !String      -- Hashtag string val
                       } deriving (Show, Eq)
```

---

## Current state of things

Define how each row maps to the declared data

```haskell
-- file simple/src/Simple/Todo.hs
instance FromRow Todo where
    fromRow = Todo <$> field -- id
                   <*> field -- title
                   <*> field -- due date
                   <*> field -- prio

instance ToRow Todo where
    toRow t = [ toField (getTitle t)
              , toField (getDueDate t)
              , toField (getPrio t)
              ]

-- file simple/src/Simple/Hashtag.hs
instance FromRow Hashtag where
    fromRow = Hashtag <$> field -- the todo id
                      <*> field -- the hashtag string

instance ToRow Hashtag where
    toRow h = [ toField . fromJust . getTodoId $ h
              , toField . getHashtag $ h
              ]
```

---

## Current state of things

#### Sample methods

```haskell
-- file src/Simple/Todo.hs
allTodos :: Connection -> IO [Todo]
allTodos conn = query_ conn q
                where
                  q = [sql| select id, title, due_date, prio
                            from todos |]

-- Same query, with 1 restriction
findTodo :: Connection -> Int -> IO (Maybe Todo)
findTodo conn tid = do
               result <- query conn q (Only tid)
               return $ if length result == 1 then
                    Just (head result)
               else
                    Nothing
               where
                 q = [sql| select id, title, due_date, prio
                           from todos
                           where id = ? |]
```

That was simple enough!

---

## Current state of things

However...

```haskell
-- Same query again, this time sorted in a specific way
allTodosByPrio :: Connection -> IO [Todo]
allTodosByPrio conn = query_ conn q
                      where
                        q = [sql| select id, title, due_date, prio
                                  from todos
                                  order by prio desc
                                  nulls last |]

-- Same query as before, this time with another restriction
allLateTodos :: Connection -> IO [Todo]
allLateTodos conn = query_ conn q
                    where
                      q = [sql| select id, title, due_date, prio
                                from todos
                                where due_date < current_date |]

```

What's the problem?

## Current state of things

Although `postgresql-simple` is amazing, let's look at a few issues we wish we could address:

#### Problems

1. I'm repeating myself constantly.
2. My queries are almost always the same, varying in by restriction, or order
specification.
3. "QuasiQuoted" strings are hard to concatenate... but do we really want that?
**NO!** QuasiQuotes are hard to concatenate on purpose!
4. My `FromRow` and `ToRow` instances will be constantly in need of updates
as the requirements change.
5. I could write an query in a quasiquote and not know that anything is wrong
until I run it.
6. I have no guarantee that I'm typing a type-safe query (i.e. The `getDate`
from `Todo` could be a `String`, and my program would compile, but it would
not crash until I run it, since the field in the table is defined as a `date`.

---

## Current state of things

#### Bad `Todo` definition

```haskell
-- file simple/src/Simple/BadTodo.hs
data BadTodo = BadTodo !(Maybe Int) -- Can be null
                       !String      -- Title of the todo
                       !String      -- Date of the todo, this time as a String
                       !(Maybe Int) -- Priority of the todo
                       deriving (Show)
```

Case in point:

```haskell
let getBadTodos = do {
    c <- connect defaultConnectionInfo
    badTodos <- allBadTodos -- Todos with a date type as String
}

getBadTodos

*** Exception: Incompatible {
    errSQLType = "date",
    errSQLTableOid = Just (Oid 16401),
    errSQLField = "due_date",
    errHaskellType = "Text",
    errMessage = "types incompatible"
}
```
